## Component Development:
   - All components must include default demo data for testing and preview purposes
   - When images are required, use Unsplash images as mock data
   - Demo data should be comprehensive enough to showcase all component features and states
   - Unsplash image links MUST:
     * Be direct, valid URLs
     * Include query parameters for image quality and size
     * Use HTTPS protocol
     * Specify width and height to ensure consistent image rendering
   - Example of a valid Unsplash image link:
     ```jsx
     "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494790108377-be9c29b29330?q=80&w=250&h=250&auto=format"
     ```
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     // Default demo data for a user profile component
     const defaultUserData = {
       name: "Alex Johnson",
       title: "Product Designer",
       avatar: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494790108377-be9c29b29330?q=80&w=250&h=250&auto=format",
       stats: {
         followers: 1240,
         following: 453,
         projects: 28
       }
     };
     ```
