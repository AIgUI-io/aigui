## AIGUI HTML Prototype Design Guidelines

This rule provides guidelines and templates for creating HTML prototypes for AIGUI with beautiful interfaces and left-right layouts.

### File Organization Rules

- All HTML prototype files MUST be placed in the `/designs` directory
- Use subdirectories for categorization and organization (e.g., `/designs/dashboard/`, `/designs/user-flow/`)
- Maintain a clear directory structure that reflects the application's architecture
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the purpose of each prototype


### Key Design Principles

- Use modern, clean aesthetics
- Implement responsive design
- Focus on left-right layouts for optimal workflow
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling


## Template

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
