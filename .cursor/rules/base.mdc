# AIgUI Project Overview

AIgUI is a React frontend project that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically generate data visualization and interactive UI components. The platform also includes a user community similar to GitHub, where users can:

- Share their created UI interfaces (cards, tables, charts)
- Share insights for specific domains
- Browse popular UI components
- Fork and modify existing components based on personal requirements

This project aims to democratize UI creation through AI assistance while fostering a collaborative community of creators.
