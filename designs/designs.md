# AIGUI Design Specifications

This directory contains design specifications for various features and pages of AIGUI. These design specifications guide frontend development, ensuring consistency in user interface and optimization of user experience.

## Technical Requirements

**Framework Requirement: All implementations must use Tailwind CSS.** The design specifications are created with Tailwind CSS in mind, and all styling should leverage Tailwind's utility classes for consistency, maintainability, and development efficiency. Custom CSS should be minimized and only used when absolutely necessary.

## Content Requirements
**Important: All text in design specifications must be in English.** During implementation, all text content from the original design specifications should be replaced with AIGUI-related feature descriptions and terminology. This ensures consistency for internationalization and coordination with code comments.
